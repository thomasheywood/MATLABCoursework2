%The largest challenge of this piece is the technical work. The coding
%aspect of this work was the bit that I found most difficult to work out
%and implement and is my biggest weakness. This may be due to the fact that
%this is my first time using any equipment like this and I need more
%practice to get my coding up to a good standard. However, practically 
% using the breadboard and arduino was natural to me and came to me very 
% quickly, even though it was my first time.
%In the future, I would definitely improve my knowledge and efficiency with
%functions and loops as this is the largest limitation of my work so far.
